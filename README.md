Cheetsheet
====

Cheetsheet is a method of taking text files in the Cheetsheet notation and
outputting PDF files for use by musicians.

A Cheatsheet usually has only the information needed for the appropriate
musician. For example, a rhythm guitarist may only need the "chord sheet" (the
chord names listed above the lyrics), while a drummer may need only information
about the structure of the song, with cues for sections, notes about the feel
of a section, drum tab for interesting fills leading to the next section, etc.
